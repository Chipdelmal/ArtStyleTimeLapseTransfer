# Art Style TimeLapse Transfer

This is a simple implementation of an artistic style transfer machine learning application. The idea was inspired by the movie "Loving Vincent" (http://lovingvincent.com/).
This _Mathematica_ implementation is mean for demonstration purposes only, as there are much more robust frameworks to do this, such as: https://github.com/cysmith/neural-style-tf (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/biyonka">Biyonka Liang</a> for the framework recommendation).

## Examples

These are four examples of the results of running the algorithm. Three of them are pre-trained networks on a particular artist's style, and one was created with style transfer from a painting.
